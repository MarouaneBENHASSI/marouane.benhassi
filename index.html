    <h1>Who I am?</h1>
	<img src="marouane.png" class="image" height="225" width="225">
	<p class="test"><strong><u> Who I am?</u> <br> My full name is Marouane BENHASSI, I was born on September 12th, 1997 in Marrakesh in Morocco. I have done my high school studies at Abi Al Abbes Essabti high school in the same city, where I obtained my baccalaureate degree in 2015 in physics-chemistry.<br> 
In 2016, I moved to Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech where I got my Bachelor's degree in modern physics, and my Master's degree in high energy physics and computational physics. In my Bachelor thesis, I worked on particle matter interaction and multi-detectors. The objective was to be familiar with all kinds of interactions in the nature and understand how multi-detectors work. I focused on the ATLAS and CMS detectors, installed on the LHC ring @CERN, which are ones of the biggest detectors in the world dedicate to study physics at small scales. In my Master thesis, I worked on neutrino physics with the KM3NeT experiment. The objective of that work was to study the masses and oscillations of neutrinos theoretically and experimentally and explain the KM3NeT's detectors which are ARCA and ORCA including analyzing KM3NeT's data using ROOT CERN thanks to the agreement signed between Cadi Ayyad University and the KM3NeT experiment in 2017 which gives the right to researchers and students from our university to participate in the research carried out by this experiment. The Cubic Kilometer Neutrino Telescope, or KM3NeT, is a European research infrastructure located at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. It hosts the next-generation neutrino telescope in the form of a water Cerenkov detector with an instrumented volume of several cubic kilometers distributed over three locations in the Mediterranean: KM3NeT-Fr (off Toulon, France), KM3NeT-It (off Portopalo di Capo Passero, Sicily, Italy) and KM3NeT-Gr (off Pylos, Peloponnese, Greece). The KM3NeT project continues work done under the ANTARES (telescope built off coast of France), NEMO (planned telescope off coast of Italy) and NESTOR (planned telescope off coast of Greece) neutrino telescope projects. You can find my Bachelor thesis and my Master thesis in the <a src="./articles.html"> articles </a> section.<br> 
	In July 2022, I participated in the IFJ PAN Particle Physics Summer Student (PPSS) Programme. It is organised by the Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Sciences (IFJ PAN). It is addressed to students of second or higher year of physics and similar fields from Poland and abroad. The aim was to introduce the participants to particle physics, the Standard Model of particle physics, methodology of research in this field and statistical data analysis. During this summer student, I worked on ultra perepheral collisions in ALIC. The report is available in the <a src="./articles.html"> articles </a> section <br> 
	During 2021/2022 academic year, I was a part-time teacher in physics at Massar Al Omam high school.<br>
	I am currently a PhD student at the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli in Italy, and I am continuing my work on neutrino physics with KM3NeT experiment and particulary about DOM/DU calibration and analysis in high energy physics. <br>
